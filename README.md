Automated System For Monitoring Livestock Using Deep Learning | 2023

In recent years, there have been many research studies applying computer vision
techniques to livestock farming to promote the development of livestock intelligence. These
recent research developments have therefore motivated us to develop an auto livestock
monitoring system based on convolutional neural network, deep learning. Convolutional neural
networks are widely used as an important part of computer vision, and object detection
technology based on deep learning.
I provide a smart way for monitoring the animals in the farm. By automating the
process, it would save a lot of time and costs for farm monitoring. By this system i can count the animals to check if all the animals came inside the farm before a certain time or if someone is missing. Also provide certain other processes like animal behavior recognition, animal detection and tracking for security reasons, if any animal entered inside a forbidden area, this system sent an SMS to the worker's phone. Counting by direct detection or segmentation results in duplicate recognition of animals, so i assign a unique ID to each target; this ID remains constant throughout the sequence, thus ensuring the accuracy of counting and detection. Since YOLOv3 is the most notable and convenient one-stage detector, iselected it as our baseline of detector.
